<h2 id="sampling-rate-and-nyquist-frequency">Sampling Rate and Nyquist Frequency</h2>

<p>Signals in the real world are continuous but for a computer to process the signals, they need to be sampled at a particular rate. For example, the accelerometer on your Fitbit may be sampling at 50Hz i.e. every 0.2 seconds in-order to detect steps. For example, the signal below is shown sampled at two different rates.</p>

<p>The choice of sampling rate has important implications on what periodi</p>

<p>the maximum frequency that can be filtered using frequency domain methods.</p>

<p>A surprising (but intuitively simple) result in signal processing is the Nyquist Sampling Theorem, which states that a continuous signal can be reconstructed as long as there are two samples per period for the highest frequency component in the underlying signal.</p>

<p>That is, for a perfect reconstruction, our digital sampling frequency must be at least twice as fast as the fastest frequency in our continuous signal:  ğ‘“ğ‘ =2âˆ—ğ‘šğ‘ğ‘¥(ğ‘ğ‘›ğ‘ğ‘™ğ‘œğ‘”ğ‘“ğ‘Ÿğ‘’ğ‘) .</p>

<p>For example, imagine we have an ECG signal composed of frequencies between 0 and 200 Hz. To properly digitize this signal, we must sample at  2âˆ—200Hz. So,  ğ‘“ğ‘   needs to be 400Hz.</p>
